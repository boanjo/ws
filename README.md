# ws - Weather Station
WS is a graphical frontend to be used on top of existing homeautomation (or it can be used standalone). It is NOT a homeautomation controller but simply a listener on weather related sensors. It has a hardcoded web interface (even if it is of course possible for you to change) and the reason for this is that it has been satisfactory for a number of deployments over a number of years. What is a nice looking GUI is of course in the eyes of the beholder but for some reason i still think this is the best GUI for me with clear information without distracting details. The ws page runs on any server locally (including raspberry pi) or remote and to be displayed continously on a 10" tablet. I have 3 of these systems that have been up for more than 5 years. You can use an app like the "Fully Kiosk Browser" on android. I have made my own simple app that switches webviews after fully loaded periodically every 30 sec which makes a seemless and very smooth UI experience. It also handles loss of wifi and other quirks that might happen. If there is an interest in the APP let me know and i can fix that!
